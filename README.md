#### Fixed navbar for Bootstrap Docs

---

This was made out of personal preference as well as for the few others
requesting a fixed navbar on the Bootstrap docs.

If you use Chrome, you can download this style from the extension [User
styles](https://userstyles.org/styles/110846/bootstrap-docs-fixed-navbar).
